## What is SynoBot

SynoBob is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for Synology NAS
Package "Chat" integration. Its goal is to enable you to develop robot for much
faster and easier than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing
a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple
interface and logical structure to access these libraries. SynoBot lets you
you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed
for a versatile robot.
